# Blitz3D Syntax Highlighting in Sublime Text
 What it says on the tin: Sublime Text 4 syntax highlighting for Blitz3D files (.bb, .bb_bak1, .bb_bak2, etc)

 ## Installation
 Just put `Blitz3D.sublime-syntax` into your User Packages folder. Usually, this folder is found at '%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User' (`%APPDATA%` is the location of your `AppData\Roaming` folder). You can also find it by opening the Sublime Text command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>), typing "Preferences: Browse Packages", and hitting enter.
